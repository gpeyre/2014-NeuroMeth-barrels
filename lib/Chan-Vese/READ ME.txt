  1. Motivation

================================================================================

  These codes are homework 1 for EE291 Advanced Image Processing at Tufts
  Univeristy. This course is taught by Professor Miller and is open to graduates.

================================================================================

  2. File contents

================================================================================

Folder name: CHANVESE

  Image file: 
		4colors.jpg

		brain.jpg
		flowers.jpg
  Matlab M file:
		checkstop.m
		chenvese.m
		demo chenvese.m
		Heaviside.m
		kappa.m
		maskcircle2.m
		reinitialization.m
		showphi.m

================================================================================

  3. M file functions

================================================================================

   a) checkstop.m      : check whether curve evolution is stable to stop 
   b) chenvese.m 	: main function
		   	  execute active contours without edges algorithm
   c) demo chenvese.m	: demos
   d) Heaviside.m	: Heaviside function 
   e) kappa.m	 	: calculate image curvature 
   f) maskcircle2.m	: create built-in mask 
   g) reinitialization.m: re-initialize phases for multiphase case 
   h) showphi.m	 	: display intermediate results 

Demo is written in cell structure, please execute cells one by one.
All other functions above are called by the main function: CHENVESE.
   
================================================================================

  4.  Installations and notes

================================================================================

  Installations
   a) Extract CHENVESE folder to \\matlab\work\
   b) Add a path in Matlab for this folder
  
  Notes:
   a) Codes have been tested under Windows XP SP2, with 3G memory 
      and Core2 2.66G CPU. Run time for each demo is about 5-30sec.
      It may take longer run time for worse configurations. No test 
      in MAC system.
   b) These codes passed the tests under MATLAB 2008a and 2007 and 
      might be not compatiable with older versions.
   c) Make sure your MATLAB contains IMAGE PROCESSING TOOLBOX,
      because some codes call built-in functions in that toolbox.
   d) All images contained in the folder come from INTERNET.

=============================================================================  
   
  5.  Play with codes

=============================================================================

   a) Please read HELP file carefully.
   b) Open demo.m and execute codes as shown in HELP.
   c) After you get known what's going on, try to revise parameters and see 
      what happens.
   d) Furthermore, find some other images to play with.
